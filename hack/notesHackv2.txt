Method:
	Handle the h/g/w threads as a set
	For every ONE hack thread, calculate number of grow threads and security threads, that are required to bring server back down to "perfect" state (min security / max money)
	Delay the hack and grow threads start time to end at the same time as weaken threads.

Issues
	Ending the threads at the same time causes issues as the order the threads finish DO matter.
		Want the hack to finish first, then grow, then weaken

	SECURITY LEVEL IMPACTS THE TIME OPERATIONS TAKE
		This likely affected the timing calculations and causes timing issues

	To be more efficient, the set should finish with h/w/g/w
		Hack from max, weaken to lower security, grow back to max, then weaken to lower security again
		Script should do something like the following:

	W |---------------|
	W   |---------------|
	G      |-------------|
	H          |-------|
