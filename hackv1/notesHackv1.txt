Method:
	Individual hack/grow/weak scripts
		- this allows for better use of RAM on hosts as each script has minimum RAM requirement
	Gets a list of all servers that has at least RAM to run at least one thread of the h/g/w scripts
	One controller to distribute all hack threads, then grow, then weaken. 

Issues:
	Once the amount of threads reaches a certain point, it will be draining servers to $0 (and beyond), wasting a lot of threads when hacking.
		Similar for the grow/weak threads
