Method:
	Very similar to hackv2 but the timing is different for the batches
	
	To be more efficient, the set should finish with h/w/g/w
		Hack from max, weaken to lower security, grow back to max, then weaken to lower security again
		Script should do something like the following:

	W |---------------|
	W   |---------------|
	G    |-------------|
	H        |-------|
